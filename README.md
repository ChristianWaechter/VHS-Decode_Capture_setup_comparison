# Comparison of different capture setups used with vhs-decode

[vhs-decode](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode) is a way to decode RF captures of old video tapes. To do such captures, one needs a PC/Laptop with some kind of fast ADC, some kind of amplifier for the RF signal and a VCR that plays the actual tape and provides this raw RF signal. There are several possible hardware configurations for such a capture system. Some are already obsolete and have been replaced by better solutions. Some are alternatives without actual replacing other options. The most common capture setups shall be compared here.

***Currently work in progress and more of a brainstorming platform***
